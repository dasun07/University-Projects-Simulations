*************************************
Make sure that all these files are in the same folder when the code files are tested.
Moreover, the data files ABR_rec.mat, ECG_rec.mat, ECG_template.mat, ECG_with_noise.mat should also be in the same folder as all of these files (Data files were not included as it exceeded upload limit size, only the MATLAB scripts and certain variable MAT files are includes)
*************************************
The files in the folder are summarized below.
