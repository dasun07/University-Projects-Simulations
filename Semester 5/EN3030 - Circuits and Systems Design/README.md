# Image Downsampling Processor

The project requirement is to design and simulate/implement a processor that could down-sample a given 256x256 image by a factor of 2. That is, to obtain a 128x128 image from the input image. The input image is transmitted to the processor where the image is down-sampled and once finished, the results are sent back for display purposes.

The code files could be found in the repository: [Proc_Downsampling](https://github.com/ChaminduS/Proc_Downsampling)
